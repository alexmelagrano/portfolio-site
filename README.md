# Personal Website

Version one of this website has been live for nearly a year and a half, and it's no longer a great representation of my capabilities, services, nor design style.  That means it's time for a v2.  Running on Flask and hosted on an EC2 instance, this is much cooler than the "one html/css file" setup it is replacing.  

The website serves as a compliment to my official resume and LinkedIn page; including a bio, a list of coding projects, and little hint of spice thanks to Twitter and Spotify's APIs, this can paint a decent picture of who I am.  

Additionally, the second stage of this site is a photography portfolio, which will use Flask to retrieve photos from dedicated Flickr albums.


This website served as my introduction to Flask.
